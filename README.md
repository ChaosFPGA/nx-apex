## Overview

This software provides advanced cheat features for *Apex Legends* on a modded Nintendo Switch (NX) running custom firmware (CFW). Designed for players seeking a competitive edge, it includes aimbot, ESP, glow, no-recoil, and miscellaneous features. **Note**: These features are speculative and may require significant technical expertise to implement due to *Apex Legends*’ server-side anti-cheat and Switch hardware limitations.

## Requirements

To use this software, you need the following:

- **Unpatched Nintendo Switch (NX)** or a patched Switch with a modchip.
- **RCM Jig** (Optional: RCM Loader for easier CFW injection).
- **SD Card** (128 GB or 256 GB recommended for CFW and cheat files).
- **PC/Laptop and USB-C Cable** for CFW setup and file transfers.
- **Original Nintendo Switch Dock + Charger** (for higher FPS/overclocking, if supported).

Ensure your Switch is running a compatible CFW (e.g., Atmosphere) and follow a trusted guide like [switch.hacks.guide](https://switch.hacks.guide) for setup. Always use emuMMC to protect your sysMMC from bans.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Set Up CFW**:
   - Follow [switch.hacks.guide](https://switch.hacks.guide) to install Atmosphere CFW on your unpatched Switch or modchipped patched Switch.
   - Use an RCM Jig (or RCM Loader) and USB-C cable to enter Recovery Mode (RCM).
   - Configure emuMMC to protect your sysMMC from bans.

2. **Prepare SD Card**:
   - Format a 128/256 GB SD card (FAT32 or exFAT).
   - Copy the cheat software files (provided upon purchase) to the SD card’s `/atmosphere/contents/<ApexLegendsTitleID>/cheats/` folder.
   - Note: The TitleID for *Apex Legends* is `0100F2300F4D6000`. Verify your game’s BuildID matches the cheat files.

3. **Install Homebrew Tools**:
   - Download **EdiZon**, **Tesla Menu**, and **Ultrahand Overlay** from [CFWaifu.com](https://cfwaifu.com) or GitHub.
   - Place homebrew files in the SD card’s `/switch/` folder.

4. **Apply Cheats**:
   - Launch *Homebrew Menu* trough title takeover to avoid giving the software too low amount of memory.
   - Open Loader, select Account that u want to use, and wait for game to boot, then enable desired cheats (e.g., Aimbot, ESP).
   - Test features in Training Mode or Bot Royale to ensure stability.

5. **Overclocking (Optional)**:
   - For 120 FPS support, use **Sys-Clk** to overclock your Switch (e.g., 921 MHz GPU).
   - Requires the original dock and charger to avoid overheating.
   - Warning: Overclocking may reduce hardware lifespan or cause crashes.

## Usage Notes

- **Offline Only**: Use cheats in offline modes (e.g., Training, Bot Royale) to minimize ban risks. Online play with cheats may trigger EA’s anti-cheat (EAC) or Nintendo’s server checks.
- **Ban Protection**: Install **90DNS** or **Incognito** to block Nintendo servers. Backup your NAND via Hekate before modding.
- **Compatibility**: Ensure your *Apex Legends* version matches the cheat’s BuildID to avoid crashes. Update cheats after game patches.
- **Stability**: Features like 120 FPS or server-side name changer are experimental and may not work due to Switch hardware limits and server validation.
- **Support**: Contact `@ChaosFPGA` on Discord for technical support or updates.

## Risks and Limitations

- **Ban Risks**: Using cheats in *Apex Legends* risks permanent EA account bans and Nintendo console bans, especially online
- **Technical Feasibility**: Aimbot, ESP, and server-side features (e.g., name changer) may be limited due to ARM hardware constraints.
- **Hardware Risks**: Overclocking for 120 FPS can overheat your Switch, requiring thermal paste replacement or reducing battery life.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Cheating disrupts fair play and may harm the *Apex Legends* community. Consider practicing in Bot Royale for skill improvement without cheats.
